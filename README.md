# Daily Journal

This project uses Node.js as backend and EJS for rendering the webpages.
The Daily Journal allows you to compose posts with a title and message using the url-     /compose

Then that post will appear on the home screen through dynamic rendering using EJS. You can also see a specific post using the url-      /posts/{nameofpost}
